*Longtermism* is the view that positively influencing the long-term future is a key moral priority of our time — that society should be doing much more to protect future generations. I think it's an idea more people should know about.

In its specifics, it's a a new school of thinking (the term was only coined in 2017), so it can be difficult to know where to start learning about it. So I made [longtermism.com](https://longtermism.com/) as an introduction to longtermism for a general audience.

The site includes an [introduction](https://longtermism.com/introduction) essay, an [FAQ](https://longtermism.com/faq), a list of [resources](https://longtermism.com/resources) to learn more, and a list of [ways to get involved](https://longtermism.com/get-involved).

There's still a lot of work to do to make it anything like complete, so I aim to update it soon. In the meantime, I'd really value constructive feedback about this project — if you spot a mistake, disagree with a point, think I missed something obvious, or have any ideas for making the site better, [I'd love to hear from you](https://www.finmoorhouse.com/contact/).

I also wrote an [introductory essay about longtermism for effectivealtruism.org](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism).
