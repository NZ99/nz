[Hear This Idea](https://hearthisidea.com/) is a podcast showcasing new thinking in philosophy, economics, and effective altruism. I started it in late 2019 with [Luca Righetti](https://lucarighetti.com/), a Research Fellow at [Open Philanthropy](https://openphilanthropy.org/) and one of my closest friends.

Here are five episodes I'm especially happy with:

- [Isabelle Boemeke on Nuclear Power and Science Communication](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/isabelle/)
  - Isabelle Boemeke is a fashion model who became a leading advocate for nuclear power. You can watch her recent [TED talk here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESAaz9v4mSU). We hear her story, and the case for nuclear. When people ask for an episode to listen to first, I often think of this one.
- [Keith Frankish on Illusionism about Consciousness](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/keith)
  - Keith is perhaps best known for his 'illusionist' theory of consciousness: the view that phenomenal consciousness is a kind of pervasive illusion. I find this idea fascinating and this conversation helped me understand illusionism better.
- [Anders Sandberg on the Fermi Paradox, Transhumanism, and so much more](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/anders)
  - If you know anything about Anders Sandberg then you know it is impossible to have an uninteresting conversation with him.
- [Glen Weyl on Pluralism, Radical Markets, and Social Technology](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/glen)
- [Thomas Moynihan on the History of Existential Risk](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/thomas)
- [Michael Aird on how to do Impact-Driven Research](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/aird)
  - If you are considering a career related to impact-driven research, you will likely get a lot of concrete (and good) advice from listening to this episode.

We write an accompanying article [for each episode](https://www.hearthisidea.com/episodes) which typically includes a full transcript, reading recommendations, and as many relevant links as we can find.
