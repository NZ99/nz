[*What We Owe The Future*](https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/) is a book by philosopher William MacAskill about making the long-run future go better. I contributed to the book in a few small ways:

- Primarily, I helped make some of the graphics for the book, such as the graphics in Chapter 8, about population ethics. I worked alongside [Taylor Jones](https://eadesigner.co.uk/), who is a significantly more talented graphic designer, and who is responsible for ~all of the more complex or impressive graphics and illustrations in the book
- I commented on early drafts of the book
- I also helped with the promotional effort for the book
