Charity Entrepreneurship is a is an effective altruist organization that helps launch high-impact charities. Like a startup incubator for nonprofits. Thousands of hours of research, looking for the most promising ideas for charities which do not yet exist, informs which charities they choose to launch (see [this year's recommendations](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/charity-ideas.html) for illustration). Past charities started by Charity Entrepreneurship include the [Happier Lives Institute](https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/), [Good Policies](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/igjJ3LrgrfWNm5Zzq/introducing-good-policies-a-new-charity-promoting-behaviour), [Animal Advocacy Careers](https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/), [P.E.N](https://www.policyentrepreneurs.org/index.html), [Suvita](https://www.suvita.org/), and the [Fish Welfare Initiative](https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/).

I joined CE for Summer 2020 as their data visualisation intern. This included visualisations for research reports, editing videos for the incubation program, producing videos for social media with motion graphics, formatting reports, creating t-shirt designs, and designing the covers of an upcoming book for publication.
