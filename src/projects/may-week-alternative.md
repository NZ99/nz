In Oxford and Cambridge, 'May Week' is the period at the end of the academic year when students celebrate the end of exams; often by attending lavish and expensive 'May balls'. When I was at Cambridge I learned about an initiative to celebrate May Week in a different way: by encouraging students to donate roughly the cost of a ticket (Â£150) to a highly cost-effective charity called the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/), and then hosting a garden party to celebrate. Since none of the donations are spent on the party, and thanks to matched funding, *200%* of student donations go directly to charity. When they mentioned they were looking for someone to make them a promotional video, I volunteered my time.
