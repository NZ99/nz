I helped set up the [Effective Ideas](https://effectiveideas.org/) blog prize, which was set up with the aim of giving away up to $500k in prizes to the best new and recent blogs about effective altruism, longtermism, and related topics.

Here's some copy from the website:

>Some of the nation’s foremost public intellectuals—like Matthew Yglesias and Ezra Klein—started as bloggers. [SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/), [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/), [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/), [Overcoming Bias](https://www.overcomingbias.com/), [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/), [the Money Illusion](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/), [Cold Takes](https://www.cold-takes.com/), and [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) and the [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/) have shaped our worldviews. We’re eager to nurture the next generation  of public thinkers, and support a flourishing discourse on the most  important issues.
