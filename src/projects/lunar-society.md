I was [interviewed](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/fin-moorhouse#details) by Dwarkesh Patel for his podcast [The Lunar Society](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/).

I'm a big fan of his podcast and writing, so this was a real honour for me.

We ended up speaking about:

- Ambition and entrepreneurship in philanthropy
- Space governance
- The idea of the 'long reflection'
- 'Many worlds' interpretations of quantum mechanics

Other episodes of the show you should check out:

- [Tyler Cowen](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/tyler-cowen-2#details)
- [Bethany McLean](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/bethany-mclean#details)
- [Ed Glaeser](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/edward-glaeser#details)

I'm also happy to have made comments on an early draft of [this post](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/the-simmer-scenario) about long-run growth scenarios.
