Before I started working full-time, I made a lot of films. Some of this was freelance filmmaking as a way to make money; other films I made to enter into small contests, and similar.

Here are some highlights:

### Growth

*Growth* is a short animation about a farmer who grows a corn  maze. The landscapes of the films were made through a mix of  photography, paper cut-outs, and 3D models. For instance, the farmer  himself and his house were cut out of card and digitally scanned,and the fields of grass and wheat were modelled and animated in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). I was 14 years old when I made it and I would hve done some things differently today. Still, I'm still quite proud of it.

### Pamoja

In 2015 I was given the opportunity to produce three films for a live orchestral accompaniment, to be projected during a concert in the Bath Assembly Rooms. Composer Mark David Boden scored the music and handed the result to me to work from.

The first film uses footage from a trip to Kenya. The second is a short wordless film following my little sister as she wakes up early to take a photo of the sunrise. It [won a 'Future8' award](https://web.archive.org/web/20220203025327/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/future-8-tech-teenagers-awards). The third is an animation about a man who opens his office door to a series of new worlds.

### Crossfit competitions

I made videos for [Strength in Depth](https://strengthindepth.com), a series of 'fitness racing' competitions across the UK.

I covered the events, interviewed atheletes, made animated promotional films, and similar. Crossfit competitions are surprisingly fun to be part of.

You can watch some of the videos on the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9LKEdWKq4R2WG_-oVbjbQ/videos) channel, although not all of them are mine. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTZjUBEhdDg) an example of a promotional clip.

### Showreels

These are from 2016 (when I was 17), a year or so before I stopped making films.
