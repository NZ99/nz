In 2020 and early 2021, I helped [Liv Boeree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv_Boeree) with planning, editing, research, and animations for her videos. Here are some videos I worked on:

- [On a breakthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM7J56OxA6w) in room temperature superconductors
  - Note that the results this video was based on have since been [called into question](https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-or-bust-claim-room-temperature-superconductivity-draws-fire)
- [A conversation about creative processes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA4XgVOYkLA) with Tim Urban
- [An interview about the edges of our universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea3e52Uu4aQ) with my colleague Toby Ord
  - [I wrote a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/finmoorhouse/status/1529763804309069824) about this video featuring some of the animations I made

Liv is a science communicator and former professional poker player.

Now retired from pro poker, Liv now [gives talks](https://www.ted.com/talks/liv_boeree_3_lessons_on_decision_making_from_a_poker_champion?language=en) and makes videos for her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LivBoeree/videos), explaining ideas in science, futurism, and [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).

In her previous life, she is a World Series of Poker and European Poker Tour champion, and the only female player in history to win both a WSOP bracelet and an EPT event. In 2014, she co-founded [Raising for Effective Giving](https://reg-charity.org/), an organisation that encourages poker players to donate to effective charities, and provides resources to that end. As of July 2020, Raising for Effective Giving has raised over $14,000,000 for its supported charities.
