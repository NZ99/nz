## About

This is the current version of my personal website and blog, TBD.

This is a static site built on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and a small number of additional plugins.

The `/writing` page has a Nunjucks shortcode for sidenotes, heavily inspired by Gwern's post on ['Sidenotes In Web Design'](https://gwern.net/sidenote).

Images are sourced from a [separate](https://github.com/finmoorhouse/fm-images) [LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) repo to be processed by `eleventy-img`. They are cached across builds, remotely and locally.

## Installation

You're welcome to use this site as a starter for your own site or blog, but note that it's incomplete, poorly documented, and not built for legibility.

Still, to run the site locally:

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

Comments, questions, and pull requests are welcome!
